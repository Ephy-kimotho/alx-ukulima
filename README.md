## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to Ukulima, an e-commerce platform designed to help farmers purchase farm resources such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This platform provides an easy-to-use interface for users to search, filter, and purchase agricultural products seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Product Listings:** Browse through a wide range of farm resources.
- **Filtering:** Easily find products using category-based filtering.
- **Product Details:** View in-depth information about each product.
- **Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

This application was developed using:

- **Next.js (Pages Router)** for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React** for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern styling.
- **Lucide React & React Icons** for intuitive UI components.
- **Context API** for managing authentication and user state.
- **Axios** for making API requests.
- **Formik** for building the forms.
- **Yup** for form validation.

### Application Structure

The app is structured into various components, including:

- **Home:** Displays featured products and categories.
- **Products:** Lists all available products with filtering functionality.
- **Product Details:** Shows detailed information about selected products.
- **Cart:** Allows users to manage selected products before checkout.
- **Checkout:** Handles order confirmation and payment processing.
- **Authentication Pages:** Handles login and registration.
- **Layout:** Provides a consistent header and footer across all pages.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

During development, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **Maintaining Query Parameters:** Ensuring category filters persist across page reloads.
- **State Management:** Efficiently managing authentication and cart state with the Context API.
- **API Handling:** Creating and managing API routes efficiently in Next.js.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- **Creating API Routes in Next.js:** Setting up backend endpoints for product retrieval and user authentication.
- **State Management with Context API:** Managing global state efficiently without external libraries.
- **File Based routing:** how to route statically and also dynamically within a next js application.

## 🌟 What I Am Most Proud Of

I'm particularly proud of how the authentication system, product listing, and filtering work together seamlessly. The integration of API routes and state management has provided a smooth user experience, making the platform intuitive and easy to navigate.
